dotfiles
========

This is a repository with my dotfiles, for easy replication on UNIX machines.
The `master` branch is meant to run on linux servers, and `osx` helps with my
laptop workstations.

Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lemonzi/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
